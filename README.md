Hello, I'm Evren.

I am a Front End Developer. Actually I am a Software Engineer.

I live in Istanbul. I am a vocational high school graduate of information technology. I am currently a senior student in Computer Programming at Kocaeli University. 

I am studying distance and secondary education (evening). I have good command of HTML and CSS languages, intermediate level of JS language, entry level of C and PHP languages.

I have works with Vue.js and nuxt.js.

Currently, I continue to receive trainings on udemy, youtube and BTakademi. 

However, while I am aware that the education I will receive with you will have high returns for me, you should have no doubt that I will try to take something from you and make it useful.

I don't have a project in my Github profile, I couldn't add source code because I work on a company basis.

At the end of the training, I aim to develop new and useful projects by building on the knowledge I have gained with you.
